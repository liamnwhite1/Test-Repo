  ORNL Slicer 2 is a slicing program for additive
  manufacturing. It takes a solid body mesh object,
  typically as .STL file, and converts that into machine
  readable instructions, called g-code, that a 3D printer
  can use to build the object. The functionality includes
  loading and positioning an object, slicing it into layers,
  fitting toolpaths to the layers, and outputting g-code to
  construct the object. All of this is contained within a
  graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to
  define all of the settings specific to their machine and
  process, then preview the resultant g-code before starting
  the printing process.
